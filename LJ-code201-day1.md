##  LJ Code 201 - Day 1


> Today I felt like I'm getting wayyy more comfortable using Git. Also my arch nemesis the command line is very quickly warming up to me and becoming my best friend. I love how much quicker I can work using the command line and getting really used to it although I still have to look at my notes for some of the commands. Overall it was fun to build out my first small app and I went a little beyond what the class entailed.
