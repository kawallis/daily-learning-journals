##  LJ Code 201 - Day 2


> Today I felt like I'm getting wayyy more comfortable using Git. Also my arch nemesis the command line is very quickly warming up to me and becoming my best friend. I love how much quicker I can work using the command line and getting really used to it although I still have to look at my notes for some of the commands. Overall it was fun to build out my first small app and I went a little beyond what the class entailed.

##  LJ Code 201 - Day 3


> Wow today was alot harder than what I imagined it would be. Overall I was able to complete the lesson and learned alot. One thing I learned was to definitly debug using your console. I would have finished about 30 minutes sooner if I used the console more. Also I learned there are some differences in using the operator == and ===. Still have not fully finished my css template but I'm getting close and should be 100% done by tomorrow.

##  LJ Code 201 - Day 4


> Day four went really easily actually me and Michele pair programmed. It was my first time pair programming and it wasn't as easy as I thought. However it forced us to collaborate and I ended up learning alot of new commands to help speed up my workflow. Also we struggled alot through Git but Amy helped explain alot and slowly but surely I'm starting to understand it.

##  LJ Code 201 - Day 5


> Day five.. WOW! went crazy trying to solve functions within functions. It was actually kinda fun once I got it going. I was given a problem similar in a Hackathon back in college and was not able to solve it so it was nice figuring it out.

##  LJ Code 201 - Day 6


> Today was by far my favorite lesson so far. Although I have experience coding objects were always a struggle for me back in college. It was awesome getting the concept solidified in my mind and I was able to complete the lab fairly quickly. The last thing that I need to figure out is constructors but I think we are doing that tomorrow. I feel super confident going forward and hope everything else is as clear as its been so far.

##  LJ Code 201 - Day 7

>WOW WOW todays was crazy. I'm honestly surprised I was able to solve the bottom row problem fairly quickly. However I'm not sure I did it in the best way so curious how Aaron would do it. Tomorrow I'm hyped to start styling my page because as of now it looks sooo bad.
